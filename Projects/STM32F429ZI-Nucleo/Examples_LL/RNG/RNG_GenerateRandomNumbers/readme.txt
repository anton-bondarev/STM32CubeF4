@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure RNG peripheral to allow generation of 
32-bit long Random Numbers. Peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services 
functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example execution:
After startup from reset and system configuration, RNG configuration is performed.
(Configure Main PLL to enable 48M domain, then enable PLLQ output mapped on 48MHz domain clock).

User is then asked to press key button (LED1 blinking fast).
On user button press, several (8) Random 32bit numbers are generated
(DRDY flag is polled until 1, indicating a random number has been generated and could be retrieved from DR register).
Corresponding generated values are available and stored in a u32 array (aRandom32bit), 
whose content could be displayed using debugger (Watch or LiveWatch features).
After successful Random numbers generation, LED1 is turned On. 
In case of errors, LED1 is slowly blinking (1sec period).

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F429xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F429ZI-Nucleo Rev B board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
 - Push User button and use Variable watch window from debugger to access to values of generated numbers.
   (A break point could be set on LED_On() call, at end of RandomNumbersGeneration() function).
